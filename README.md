# Qiskit Advocates Application Guide

## What is the Qiskit advocate program?
The Qiskit advocate program is a global initiative to support the most active members of the Qiskit community. As an advocate, you will join the most passionate group of people in quantum computing. Since the program was launched two years ago, [more than 200 people with diverse backgrounds from  30+ countries have joined](https://qiskit.org/advocates/). We work together to grow the Qiskit community through organizing events, making open source contributions to Qiskit code, creating educational content, and more.

## Why you should apply:

### 1. Networking with experts and enthusiasts
As an advocate, you will be able to attend monthly meetup sessions to share projects and ideas and work together with fellow advocates on new projects and events.

### 2. Getting special access to Qiskit core members and projects
As an advocate, you will be able to ask questions to members of the Qiskit team and find a mentor through our [mentorship program](http://qisk.it/advocate-mentorship).

### 3. Being recognized by IBM
As an advocate, you will have the opportunity to have your work supported and highlighted by IBM.

### 4. Receiving invitations to events
As an active advocate, you will be invited to global (physical or virtual) events created for the quantum community such as Qiskit Camps and IBM Quantum Challenges.

## Who can apply?
We welcome anyone who is enthusiastic about quantum computing and eager to grow the Qiskit community.

## How you can apply:

Here are the steps for applying to become an advocate:

1. **Make at least 3 contributions to Qiskit code and community (now - Jul 1, 2021)**
Community contributions can vary depending on individual interests including code, tutorials, textbook chapters, bug reporting, Slack support, blogs, videos, events, and more. See the Contribution section below for different types of contributions that you could make.
1. **Take the advocate test (Jun 1 - Jul 1, 2021)**
This should take 90 minutes depending on your knowledge of Qiskit.
1. **Submit application form (Jun 1 - Jul 1, 2021)**
by July 1, 2021 11:59 PM EDT.
1. **Application review (Jul 1 - Aug 1, 2021)** conducted by the Qiskit advocate squad
1. **Onboarding (Aug 5, 2021)**

*Dates may be subject to change*

## Test

[Here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-advocate-test) is an example of the Qiskit advocate test from last year. The format for this year may change. But it will be multiple choice questions testing your Qiskit knowledge.
