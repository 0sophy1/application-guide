# Qiskit Advocate Application Guide

## What is the Qiskit advocate program?
The Qiskit advocate program is a global initiative to support the most active members of the Qiskit community. As an advocate, you will join the most passionate group of people in quantum computing. Since the program was launched two years ago, more than 200 people with diverse backgrounds from  30+ countries have joined. We work together to grow the Qiskit community, from organizing events to making open source contributions to Qiskit code and educational content.

## Why should you apply?

### Networking with experts and enthusiasts
As an advocate, you will be able to attend monthly meetup sessions to share projects and ideas with fellow advocates, and work together with them on new projects and events.

### Getting special access to Qiskit core members and projects
As an advocate, you will be able to ask questions to members of the Qiskit team and even find a mentor among them through our mentorship program.

### Being recognized by IBM
As an advocate, you will have the opportunity to have your work supported and highlighted by IBM. In fact, many advocates have become interns or even work full time for IBM Quantum and Qiskit.

### Receiving invitations to events
As an active advocate, you will be invited to global (physical or virtual) events created for the quantum community such as Qiskit Camps and IBM Quantum Challenges.
